This Greenhouse Automation project involves several key components:
- **Arduino Uno**: The core microcontroller used to control the greenhouse environment.
- **Proteus Simulation Software**: Used for designing and simulating the entire circuit, including the sensor, power circuits, power source, and actuator control circuits.
- **Modular Software Structure**: The software is divided into multiple modules to facilitate easy maintenance and future improvements.

### Features
- **üå°Ô∏è Sensor Measurement Module**: Collects data from various sensors (e.g., temperature, humidity, light intensity, soil moisture).
- **üìä Data Display Module**: Visualizes the sensor data in real-time.
- **‚öôÔ∏è Control Commands Module**: Adjusts environmental parameters such as light, temperature, humidity, and soil moisture.
- **‚è≥ Simulated Time Module**: Allows quick observation of changes by simulating time progression.
- **üïí Time-Based Parameter Adjustment**: A hardcoded mechanism (to be externalized into a configuration file in future iterations) that adjusts greenhouse parameters based on the time of day, optimizing plant growth.
- **üîå Actuators Circuit**: Controls the heating lamp, water pump, lighting, and fan to maintain the desired environmental conditions.

### Technical Details
